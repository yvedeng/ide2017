  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/tmipiechart.gif"><li>Interactive Visualization 1 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
    It has very clear legends and is very informative. 
  </p>

  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  This visualization puts too much information which makes it much more complicated to read. It should establish a new pie chart for every seperate part of the original chart.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/badscale.png"><li>Interactive Visualization 2 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  This bar charts is well-orgnized and represents information directly. 
  </p>
  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  In this example, the bars sizes uses wrong scale which leads to represent data inaccurately, i.e. this bar chart shows that the average cost of a qualified lead through local SEO is about half the cost of a lead from Print & Traditional media. However the actual number is in fact close to 8 times higher.

  My data set is gathered from a competition. Based on time series, it contains the number of vehicles across 4 junctions of a city per hour over 20 months. The visualizing graph would be able to say the trends of the the number of vehicles and help to build a smarter city. For example, if we know one of the junction always occurs traffic jam in a specific time, the major can execute some rules to avoid this situation. The graph would be zoomable like this:
