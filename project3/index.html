    <h1>Project 3</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Family Tree</h2>
    <div id="familytree"></div>

    <p>We took photo from google for each member of Trump family and set this photo as our shape of node.
        For the tree layout, we show the relationship between parent and children. When mouse is hovering over the node,
        it shows the name, both parents, current and previous spouses of the person denoted.
        Nodes can be clicked, if it has children nodes, these children nodes will be folded or unfolded.</p >

    <h2>Part 2: Explanations </h2>
    <ol><li><b>Motivation</b></li>
        <p> We choose tree layout simply because we were asked to create a family tree. The reason we did not show the partner information
            is that we weren't able to successfully code it and we didn't want to mess up the relationship between parents and children using
            same branches for both or do it manually (hardcoding nodes based on our data). Therefore to make everything clear, we decided to make it
            simplier, following only Trump family tree and adding spouses to information box which is shown when hovering over the persons photo. </p>
        <p> The info box when the cursor move over the picture was created since we want to show as much as information as possible.</p>
        <p> We decided to use their picture to illustrate their relationship because it looks nicer and friendlier comparing to the text. As well as
            almost everyone have seen some pictures of Donald Trump children but very few know their names. That helps to relate to these people.</p>


        <li> <b>Suggest how/if the visualization could be improved by adding interactive elements</b> </li>
        <p>Information box could hold link to the Wiki page and a little bit more information, i.e. age.</p>
        <p>Properly executing partnership branches</p>
        <p>Scaling images with the same size or format to make this visualization more elegant. </p>
        <p>Plot itself could be scaling with size required to show all not hidden pictures</p>
