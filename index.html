  <h3 >Create a list with links to two interactive visualizations</h3>
  
  <p>We were not sure whether we should comment more on old ones based on questions or totally change visualizations so we did both.</p>
  
  <h3>Old ones:</h3>
  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/tmipiechart.gif"><li>Non-Interactive Visualization 1 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  It is very informative. Pie chart has obvious advantages over other type of graphs when you want to visualize data and a lot of text in just one plot. You can provide information all around the pie chart. It is best you can do without going into interactive visualization. 
  </p>

  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  Visualization by itself lacks information what is shown. It is pretty complicated to read. It could be remade to more interactive visualization where you only see additional information when you mouseover or click on one of the parts. Split between consumer and producer parts could be shown only on mouseover as well and compared in ratio.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/badscale.png"><li>Non-Interactive Visualization 2 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  This bar charts is simple and straightforward. 
  </p>
  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  Plot is made to impact you by how low the number is. It doesn't show the proportion as bar between "Print and Traditional Media" and "Local SEO" differs 2 times while number differs 8. Furthermore, The bars are not alligned on the right side, even though it is seems like that.
  </p>
  
  <h3>New ones:</h3>
  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/08/27/343415569/whos-in-the-office-the-american-workday-in-one-graph?/templates/story/story_php="><li>Interactive Visualization 1 - The American Workday</li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  It has a lot of information. You can compare different fields or to average by choosing in dropbar menu as well as clicking on the lines themselves. Mouseover highlights whole line and shows field name. Dropbar menu is colored to explain what is shown under that color in the plot.
  </p>
  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  X axis has labels only every 3 hours so it is hard to know exact time. It is really hard to interpret Y axis and there are no labels, there are no information about it before or after the plot, so you can only guess.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/sports/wizards-shooting-stars/"><li>Interactive Visualization 2 - The Wizards’ shooting stars</li> </a>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  It is extremely informative. Seems like something other team would do to study and find patterns of play. You can check shooting statistics for every player, find which positions and shooting styles they prefer.
  </p>
  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  It could more interactive, e.g. Shooting by zone plot could have mouseover statistics, Shot chars could have clickable Jump shots, Layups, Dunks just to show positions for these. It lacks options to compare different players as well as it would be very interesting to see how scoring positions for a player differs based on who else on his team are on court.

  My data set is gathered from a competition. Based on time series, it contains the number of vehicles across 4 junctions of a city per hour over 20 months. The visualizing graph would be able to say the trends of the the number of vehicles and help to build a smarter city. For example, if we know one of the junction always occurs traffic jam in a specific time, the major can execute some rules to avoid this situation. The graph would be zoomable like this:
  <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series"> Graph demo</a>
  <br>
  <font color="red"> Updates: </font> <br>
  Beside of time series, I think I can also draw a map with 4 junctions and simulate the traffic flows along with the time with different colors. For example, green means it is good to go and red means it is way too crowded. When your cursor movse to the flow, it can show up the number of vehicles. At the bottom, there is a bar so that I can slide it to change the point of time. Accordingly, you can get the trends from the graphs of time series (4 plots next to one another because they are kind of independent) and the comparison of the traffic statuses on 4 junctions at the same time from the map. <br>
  With respect to the story, I would like to hear more in the class and then decide whether to use the data set or not.

  <li>Data set would be about the growth rates of different bacteria under various temperatures. I can gather data myself doing experiments.</li>
  <li>It would be as a helpsheet for choosing temperature of growing cells based on your situation. e.g. In field of biocatalysis you may need different temperature for synthesis of various proteins and sometimes you prefer limiting cell growth so it does produce only some protein because otherwise it will become insoluble.</li>
  <li>In most of the biotechnology fields, especially biocatalysis it is very important to know the growth rates. Eventhough, it could be used pretty commonly, it probbably would very useful only for a local lab I would be doing experiment in.</li>

  </ol>
  <p><font color="red"> Updates: </font></p>
  I agree with your point that my idea might slightly lack complexity for a great interactive visualization, however I thought of few things that could be done and updated my sketch:
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RY2IkhG.png" /><br />
  Left side bar is for choosing cell lines you want to see in your plot. When you choose them, they could appear on the right side and would have drop bar menu to show or hide different temperatures. Other change could be highlighting the line you are mouseovering as well as showing number of cells and time at position which is mouseovered.

  <h3> Individual part for Xiaolan </h3>
  <p>For now, take dataset of Airbnb (which is accessed from <a href="http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data">here</a>)as an example, it includes price, location, room type, average rating and so on of every accommodation for one city. Thus it would be a map that a circle cell will show the information of price, room type and average rating when you choose a locationof a city(i.e. <a href="http://projects.newyorker.com/story/citi-bike.html">Demo 1.</a>). Thus you can compare the price, room type and average rating within a list of your choice. We also can produce bar charts(i.e. <a href="https://info.datalabsagency.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/interactive-data-visualisation-example-finance-data.jpg?t=1512000802709&width=800&height=450&name=interactive-data-visualisation-example-finance-data.jpg">Demo 2.</a>) to compare the general situation among various cities.Then cities will be the category and every bar will be formed by the average of price and the percent of every room type with the average rating of the specific city.(i.e. when you choose a specific room type part of a bar, it will show the avearge rating of this room type of this city in a new window beside this bar. If you don't choose it, this window will not show)
