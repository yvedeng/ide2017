  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/tmipiechart.gif"><li>Interactive Visualization 1 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
    It has very clear legends and is very informative. 
  </p>

  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  This visualization puts too much information which makes it much more complicated to read. It should establish a new pie chart for every seperate part of the original chart.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <a href="https://www.clicdata.com/wp-content/uploads/badscale.png"><li>Interactive Visualization 2 </li> </a>
  </ul>

  <p>Postive aspects:
  <br />
  This bar charts is well-orgnized and represents information directly. 
  </p>
  <p>Negative aspects:
  <br />
  In this example, the bars sizes uses wrong scale which leads to represent data inaccurately, i.e. this bar chart shows that the average cost of a qualified lead through local SEO is about half the cost of a lead from Print & Traditional media. However the actual number is in fact close to 8 times higher.

  <h3> Yifang Deng </h3>
  My data set is gathered from a competition. Based on time series, it contains the number of vehicles across 4 junctions of a city per hour over 20 months. The visualizing graph would be able to say the trends of the the number of vehicles and help to build a smarter city. For example, if we know one of the junction always occurs traffic jam in a specific time, the major can execute some rules to avoid this situation. The graph would be zoomable like this:

  <li>Data set would be about the growth rates of different bacteria under various temperatures. I can gather data myself doing experiments.</li>
  <li>It would be as a helpsheet for choosing temperature of growing cells based on your situation. e.g. In field of biocatalysis you may need different temperature for synthesis of various proteins and sometimes you prefer limiting cell growth so it does produce only some protein because otherwise it will become insoluble.</li>
  <li>In most of the biotechnology fields, especially biocatalysis it is very important to know the growth rates. Eventhough, it could be used pretty commonly, it probbably would very useful only for a local lab I would be doing experiment in.</li>

  <h3> Individual part for Xiaolan </h3>
  <p>There are several types data i.e. norminal or ordinal, visualized with various forms of visualization, i.e. charts or maps. For now, take dataser of Airbnb (which is accessed from <a href="http://tomslee.net/airbnb-data-collection-get-the-data">here</a>) as an example, it includes room type, price, location, average rating and so on of every accommodation for several cities. The expected visualization would reflect the relationship between price and location within different cities which can help travelers take a trade-off between these attricutes. Here we can use bar chart having similar sketch with following demo, where different color reprents different location, diffferent bar denotes different city and also put a average price for one location on each part of a bar</p>
