    <p>On this page, you can compare the distribution of three room types (Entire house/apartment, Private Room, Shared Room)
    among 11 neighbourhoods, also the distribution of five price interval( see in the legend.).
    The bars is sorted by the largest part of each bar. For instance, in the barplot of Room Type,
    You can easily see that the first neighbourhood
    has least Entire House/Apartment when the bottom neigbourhood has most rooms in all of three room types.
    As the traffic of last neighbourhood is very convenient and also near to city central, it make sense that people would like
        to choose housing around bottom neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>In the barplot of price range, you can see almost all neighbours have large Price Interval of [301DKK, 1000 DKK].
    Besides Indre By have most housings in price interval [1001DKK, 1500DKK] among all neighbours.
    Correspondingly, the bar of price Interval keep the almost same ratio between two adjacent.
        It seems location is part of factor of price but not the main reason.</p>
